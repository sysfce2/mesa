/** @file

 * Implements a pass that propagates the conditional modifier from a CMP x 0.0
 * instruction into the instruction that generated x. For instance, in this
 * sequence
 *
 *    add(8)          g70<1>F    g69<8,8,1>F    4096F
 *    cmp.ge.f0(8)    null       g70<8,8,1>F    0F
 *
 * we can do the comparison as part of the ADD instruction directly:
 *
 *    add.ge.f0(8)    g70<1>F    g69<8,8,1>F    4096F
 *
 * If there had been a use of the flag register and another CMP using g70
 *
 *    add.ge.f0(8)    g70<1>F    g69<8,8,1>F    4096F
 *    (+f0) sel(8)    g71<F>     g72<8,8,1>F    g73<8,8,1>F
 *    cmp.ge.f0(8)    null       g70<8,8,1>F    0F
 *
 * we can recognize that the CMP is generating the flag value that already
 * exists and therefore remove the instruction.

          * For negative values:
          * (sat(x) >  0) == (x >  0) --- false

             *   Other instructions first store their result to
             *   dst, and then store cmod(dst) to the flag
             *   register.
             * - inst is either CMP or MOV
             * - inst->dst is null
             * - inst->src[0] overlaps with scan_inst->dst
             * - inst->src[1] is zero

             *   Considering that src0 is either 0x0 (false),
             *   or 0xffffffff (true), and src1 is 0x0:
             *
             *   - If inst's cmod is NZ, we can always remove
             *     scan_inst: NZ is invariant for false and true. This
             *     holds even if src0 is NaN: .nz is the only cmod,
             *     that returns true for NaN.
             *
             *   - .g is invariant if src0 has a UD type
             *
             *   - .l is invariant if src0 has a D type
             *
             * - scan_inst and inst have the same cmod:
             *
             *   If scan_inst is anything than CMP, it already
             *   wrote the appropriate value to the flag register.
             *
             * - else:
             *
             *   We can change cmod of scan_inst to that of inst,
             *   and remove inst. It is valid as long as we make
             *   sure that no instruction uses the flag register
             *   between scan_inst and inst.
